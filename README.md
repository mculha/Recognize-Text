## Recognize Text

The app helps us scan an image and extract all text from it using Vision Framework. The app is inspired by the [**documentation**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_text_in_images).

### Recognizing Text in Images
> One of Vision’s many powerful features is its ability to detect and recognize multilanguage text in images. You can use this functionality in your own apps to handle both real-time and offline use cases. In all cases, all of Vision’s processing happens on the user’s device to enhance performance and user privacy.
